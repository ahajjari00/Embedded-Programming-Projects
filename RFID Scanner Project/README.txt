RFID Scanner Project
Amir Hajjari

The goal behind this project was to create a system where I could configure an
RFID reader to recognize however many UID codes (in my case only 2 as I do not own more RFID cards)
and categorize them as either
"good" or "bad" depending on the specific UID code. A green LED would light
up signifying a "good" code, and a red LED would do the opposite. After looking
over my code and observing the video, I am sure the idea behind this project will be 
much more clear.

Thanks for your time!
