Temperature Sensor Project
Created by Amir Hajjari

Hi! In this project, I used the Arduino Mega to create a Temperature Sensor Interface project.

Although, there is more to it! I also used the RTC (real-time clock) chip and temperature sensor module included in the kit along with the
Joystick module to communicate with these two devices, outputting information onto the LCD screen depending on the analog position
values on the Joystick Module! This project was a lot of fun to make and I have included the code in this sub-directory. Furthermore, I
have included the link to the demonstration video directly below!

Thanks!
