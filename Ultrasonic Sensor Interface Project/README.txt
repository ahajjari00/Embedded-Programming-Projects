Ultrasonic Sensor Interface Project
Amir Hajjari

The aim of this project was to be able to "sync" an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor and a Piezo buzzer.
I had devised an algorithm to make the frequency of the buzzer increase as the position of the object, 
relative to the sensor, increases. This operation is evident in the video I included in this folder.
Furthermore, the distance an object is from the ultrasonic sensor is displayed on the LCD screen. 
If you have made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you enjoy!

Also, I would like to thank my Embedded Systems Professor, Matt Mohler, for supplying some of
the code for the HC-SRO4 sensor reading throughout the semester.
